🌌 Overview
The Coherent Quantum Oscillator Network (CQON) model is a novel physics-based framework that explores how quantum coherence may mediate the conversion from energy to structured information - a potential process underlying life's emergence. This model provides standardized assessment criteria for evaluating planetary habitability potential across diverse environments including Mars and exoplanetary systems.

Key Insight: Our simulations suggest quantum coherence could serve as a potential biosignature framework, with operational thresholds (⟨c⟩>0.30, islands≥3, r<-0.45) enabling systematic HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NO classification of planetary environments.

🪐 Planetary Scenarios & Assessment Results
Scenario	Parameters (α,γ,T)	Mean Coherence	Coherence Growth	Mean Islands	E-S Correlation	Life-Like
Early Earth	0.35, 0.07, 0.15	0.342 ± 0.043	246.8%	12.7 ± 2.2	-0.658 ± 0.12	✅ HIGH

Mars Microhabitat	0.28, 0.08, 0.16	0.231 ± 0.059	130.2%	7.4 ± 2.7	-0.690 ± 0.18	⚠️ LOW

📈 Operational Thresholds for Planetary Assessment
The model identifies three operational thresholds within our framework for assessing life-like organization potential:

Coherence Threshold: Mean coherence > 0.30

Island Formation: ≥3 coherence islands

Energy-Information: Strong negative correlation r < -0.45

These thresholds represent model-based criteria requiring experimental validation and should be viewed as testable hypotheses rather than fundamental physical constants.

🔬 Mars-Specific Findings
Statistical Significance Analysis
Early Earth vs Past Mars: t(28) = 7.847, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 2.966 (Large Effect)

Early Earth vs Mars Microhabitat: t(28) = 5.688, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 2.150 (Large Effect)

Early Earth vs Present Mars: t(28) = 18.045, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.820 (Very Large Effect)

Planetary Assessment Classification
✅ HIGH: Early Earth - Optimal conditions for life-emergence
